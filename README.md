# Graph_Implementations
This Repository includes codes for learning graph algorithms and their traversal methods.

The graph data is stored in txt format in the input folder.

The codes Dijkstra's Shortest path.py finds the shortest path in the graph. Also, it includes a scope checker to verify that the identifird path is the shortest one

The BFS_DFS_traversal.py code searches graph nodes by traversing either the breadth or depth of the starting node.
